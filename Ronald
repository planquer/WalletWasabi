After using Coinjoin I sent some BTC coins to Godex to exchange for ADA.`I used coins from my wasabi wallet to excange for thr ADA which I sent to my Exodus wallet. This transaction is in the blockchain no prolblem it is completed.
Afterwards maybe it's a coincidence but all the coins I coinjoined are missing from my walllet but all are showing up on the blockchain as confirmed transaction  and unspent..
Will the transaction time-out and will the BTC be returned to me?
